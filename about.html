            <h3>
                Born and raised in Estcourt, South Africa, I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst with a diploma in
                Software Development from Rosebank College. While my professional experience includes sales and graphic
                design, my true passion lies in the world of cybersecurity. Currently, I am advancing my skills and
                knowledge through an intensive program at CapaCiTi, where I am working diligently to build a successful
                career in this dynamic and ever-evolving field. The journey to discovering my passion has been both
                enriching and transformative, filled with valuable experiences that have shaped the person I am today.
                <br><br>

                It all began during my high school years, where I developed an interest in technology and
                problem-solving. After completing matric, I took on a role as a general worker at Gambushe Property,
                which instilled in me a strong work ethic and adaptability. Driven to pursue my interest in technology,
                I enrolled at Rosebank College to study Software Development. This was a pivotal moment in my life, as
                it allowed me to gain technical knowledge while also balancing part-time work as a graphic designer for
                Logoman Design. These experiences not only honed my creative skills but also taught me the importance of
                discipline and time management.
                <br><br>

                After graduating, I moved to Johannesburg in search of better opportunities in my field of study. It was
                here that I began my professional career as a sales consultant at African Bank. Though sales was not
                directly aligned with my aspirations, it was a valuable experience that strengthened my communication,
                customer service, and interpersonal skills. This role also taught me the importance of building
                relationships, an essential quality in any profession. However, my desire to work in the tech industry
                remained unwavering, motivating me to seek opportunities that aligned more closely with my interests.
                <br><br>

                My breakthrough came when I joined CapaCiTi, a program designed to equip individuals with advanced
                technical skills. Through this training, I was introduced to the fascinating world of cybersecurity, and
                I quickly realized this was the path I was meant to follow. The program not only deepened my
                understanding of cybersecurity principles but also allowed me to develop practical skills in areas such
                as threat detection, risk management, and ethical hacking. It was during this time that I truly fell in
                love with cybersecurity, captivated by its complexity and the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in
                protecting digital systems.
                <br><br>

                Looking back, my journey has been one of growth and self-discovery. Each step, from my early days as a
                general worker to my current training in cybersecurity, has played a crucial role in shaping my career
                path. The diverse experiences I have gained along the way have given me a unique perspective and a
                versatile skill set. Today, I am more determined than ever to excel in the cybersecurity field, driven
                by a passion for technology and a commitment to safeguarding the digital world. My story is a testament
                to the power of perseverance, adaptability, and following one's true calling.
